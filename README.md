## Welcome to Tiny Wanderer Adventures!

This game was inspired by lessons in [CSJ Academy](https://www.crieseusjogos.com.br/) course. The original game was build in Unity3D engine, but as a self-challenge, I builded it using Godot Engine.

The controls are simple:
- you can move the player using [A, D] for left and right
- [W] for jump
- [Left-mouse click] for attack and UI buttons.

This is a still in-progress game, but feel free to play it on [itch.io](https://kauecavalcante.itch.io/tiny-wanderer-adventures) and leave some comments with your feedback for improvments!

Here's some screenshots of the game:
